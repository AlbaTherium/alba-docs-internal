# Welcome
**Thank you for choosing Internal Ranges Analysis** 

Internal Ranges Analysis is an indicator for the Tradingview charting platform that is designed to automate the setup and maintenance tasks for traders who are utilising the Trading Hub 3.0 strategy taught by Mr Khan at https://www.youtube.com/@TRADiNGhub

The Trading Hub 3.0 methodology requires advanced knowledge and time from the trader. We have used our expert knowledge of the strategy to create automations in order to free up your time, enabling you to be more productive. Whether you choose to use the time to monitor more instruments with a view to increase your revenue potential or be more productive in other areas of life is entirely up to you! Internal Ranges Analysis enables you to set up alerts for the instruments, setups and time frames that you would like to monitor without watching Tradingview. You can set and forget until you receive an alert.

Internal Ranges Analysis is part of a suite of indicators that cover the concepts in the strategy. Please check out our other products at https://albatherium.com/
